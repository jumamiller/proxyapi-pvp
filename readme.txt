Accept Safaricom Lipa na M-Pesa payments via Proxy API using PVP's Smart Payment Button.

== Description ==
The Pay via Proxy (PVP in short) extension for WooCommerce enables you to accept payments for Safaricom\'s M-Pesa payment gateway via Proxy API.

PVP enables one to directly integrate into MPesa using both Lipa na M-Pesa and C2B APIs. It enables you to simplify your checkout process and allow a customer to simply enter their phone number and have the STK Push payment prompt sent immediately to their phone numbers, and the callback automatically processed by WooCommerce.
